# Pakistan Tourism Data Analysis

# Project by Nadir Ali Khan, Student of Certified Python Course

## Project Overview
This project generates, analyzes, and visualizes data related to tourism in Pakistan. Leveraging Python libraries like **NumPy** for data generation, **Pandas** for data manipulation, and **Matplotlib** for visualization, the project uncovers insights into tourism patterns across various cities in Pakistan. Additionally, **Streamlit** is used to create an interactive GUI, making data exploration more accessible.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Generation**: Use NumPy to create a synthetic dataset representing Pakistan tourism data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepare the dataset by ensuring consistency and removing inaccuracies.
- **Data Analysis**: Explore patterns in tourist counts, spending, accommodation, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate visual insights using Matplotlib.
- **Interactive GUI**: Use Streamlit to enable interactive exploration of tourism data.

## Key Sections in the Notebook
1. **Importing Libraries and Data Preparation**: Load essential libraries and create/generate the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze trends, including total tourists by city, average expenditures, and seasonal patterns.
3. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations for:
   - Tourist count by city
   - Seasonal tourism variations
   - And More
4. **Streamlit GUI**: Build an interactive user interface for real-time data exploration.
5. **Conclusions**: Summarize key insights from the data.

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: For generating random tourism-related data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing findings.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive GUI.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib streamlit
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `project.ipynb` to view data generation, analysis, and visualization.
3. To launch the Streamlit GUI, navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   streamlit run gui.py
   ```

## Project Insights
This project reveals key tourism trends in Pakistan, including:
- Popular cities for tourism and their seasonal dynamics.
- Patterns in tourist spending by accommodation type and stay duration.
- Preferences in transportation modes and the impact of factors like festivals and weather on tourism.

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates the power of data science in transforming raw data into actionable insights. It is an excellent project for building skills in data generation, analysis, and visualization, with the addition of a user-friendly interface for enhanced accessibility.

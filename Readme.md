# Pakistan Tourism Data Analysis

### Project by Nadir Ali Khan, Student of Certified Python Course

## Project Overview
This project aims to generate, analyze, and visualize data related to tourism in Pakistan. Using Python libraries like **NumPy** for data generation, **Pandas** for data manipulation, and **Matplotlib** for visualization, the project provides insights into tourism patterns across various cities in Pakistan.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Generation**: Create a custom dataset for Pakistan tourism using random data generation with NumPy.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data is well-structured, removing inconsistencies and preparing it for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Explore patterns in the dataset, such as tourist numbers, expenditures, and accommodation types.
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib to create charts and graphs, making the insights more accessible and visually engaging.

## Key Sections in the Notebook
1. **Importing Libraries and Data Preparation**: Load essential libraries and the generated dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform analysis to understand trends, such as total tourists by city, average expenditures, and seasonal patterns.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize key findings, including:
   - Number of tourists per city
   - Average stay duration and expenditure
   - Seasonal tourism trends
4. **Conclusions**: Summarize the key insights from the data.

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: For generating random data points relevant to tourism.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visual representations of the data.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```
2. Open and run the notebook `project.ipynb` to view data generation, analysis, and visualizations.

## Insights
This project highlights significant tourism patterns in Pakistan, such as:
- Popular cities for tourism and their seasonal variations.
- Tourist expenditure patterns based on accommodation and duration.
- Preferences in transport modes and factors influencing tourism, such as festivals and weather.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides an example of how data science tools can be used xto create, analyze, and visualize data, transforming raw information into actionable insights. It is a valuable project for learning and applying skills in data generation, analysis, and visualization.
